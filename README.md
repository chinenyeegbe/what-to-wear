Too *busy* and *important* to worry about trivialities such as clothing? **Introducing WhatToWear!** 

## WhatToWear
WhatToWear will recommend you outfits to wear based on what clothes you have available, the weather, and customized tags.

WhatToWear does not come up with the outfitsâ€”-you do, and enter them into the database once. From there, WhatToWear keeps track of your clothing inventory. You can specify how many times you are willing to rewear a piece, and after you have worn it that many times, WhatToWear will stop recommending outfits that use that piece (until you tell the app you have done your laundry).
