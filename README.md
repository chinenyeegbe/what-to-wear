Too *busy* and *important* to worry about trivialities such as clothing? Don't want to go the black turtleneck & jeans path? **Introducing WhatToWear!** 

## WhatToWear
WhatToWear will recommend you outfits to wear based on what clothes you have available, the weather, and customized tags.

WhatToWear does not come up with the outfitsâ€”-you do, and enter them into the database once. From there, WhatToWear keeps track of your clothing inventory. You can specify how many times you are willing to rewear a piece, and after you have worn it that many times, WhatToWear will stop recommending outfits that use that piece (until you tell the app you have done your laundry).

### Wow what a useful app! How do I use WhatToWear?
1) Clone this repo
2) Run `npm install`
3) Edit `inventory.json` and `outfits.json` with your info. You can use `generate_outfits.js` to help you out, or come up with your own script.  
4) Run `npm start` to run on simulator
5) Install Expo via `npm install expo-cli --global`
6) Run `expo publish`. You may have to create an account/login.
7) Download the Expo app on your phone
8) Once you login on your phone you should see 

Alternatively to these instructions, you can run `npm eject` after step 3, open the project up in Xcode, and proceed from there. I do not know how that works.
